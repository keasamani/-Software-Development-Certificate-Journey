# Introduction to HTML

**What is HTML?**

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It's the standard language used to create web pages.

**NB:** It's not a programming language; it's a markup language that structures the content of web pages.


**What Does HTML Do?**

HTML describes the structure of a webpage using *tags* and *elements*.

-It allows you to define different types of content on a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms-.

**Basic Structure of an HTML Document**

An HTML document is made up of tags that wrap content. Here’s a simple structure:

```<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is my first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Code Breakdown

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This tells the browser that you're using HTML5, the latest version of HTML.
- `<html>`: The root element that contains all the HTML code.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata like the title of the page (what shows in the browser tab).
- `<body>`: Contains the visible content on the page (text, images, etc.).

## HTML Tags and Elements

HTML uses **tags** like `<p>` for paragraphs, `<h1>` for headings, and `<a>` for links.

- Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag (e.g., `<p>`) and a closing tag (e.g., `</p>`).
- Tags are wrapped around content to define how it appears on a webpage.

### Common HTML Tags

- **Headings**: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, ..., `<h6>` for different levels of headings.
- **Paragraphs**: `<p>` to define a block of text.
- **Links**: `<a href="URL">Link Text</a>` to create hyperlinks.
- **Images**: `<img src="image_url" alt="description">` to display images.
- **Lists**: `<ul>` for unordered lists, `<ol>` for ordered lists, and `<li>` for list items.

## Importance of HTML

HTML is the foundation of every webpage on the internet. Learning HTML gives you the skills to build and structure content for the web.

As you become familiar with HTML tags, you’ll be able to create simple websites and enhance them with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript for more advanced functionality which will be available in subsequent sessions.
